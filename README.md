# Chess-Game-with-AI-Implementation
This project is a chess game developed from scratch in Python using the Pygame library. It features a fully functional chessboard and pieces, allowing a player to play against an AI opponent.
# Features
* Interactive Chessboard: A visually appealing and interactive chessboard created with Pygame.
* AI Opponent: An AI implementation that allows a player to compete against the computer. The AI uses algorithms to determine optimal moves and provide a challenging experience.
* Move Validation: Ensures all moves are legal according to chess rules, including special moves such as castling and en passant.
* Graphical User Interface: Intuitive GUI for ease of play, with drag-and-drop functionality for moving pieces.
# Technologies Used
* Python: The core programming language used for the development.
* Pygame: A set of Python modules designed for writing 2D games, used for rendering the game graphics and handling user inputs.
